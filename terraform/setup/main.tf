## Setup Dedicated Host for Mac Resources
## https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/ec2_host
## It is a requirement before creating an EC2 Mac Host
## https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-mac-instances.html
## Moreover, you can only place 1 mac instance on a dedicate host a single time.
## Therefore, limit down the scope for testing in Mac since EC2 can be done with Linux
## and Mac under the hood share similar plugins with Linux
## Mac has scrubbing to avoid patching
